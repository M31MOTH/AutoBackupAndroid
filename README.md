# AutoBackupAndroid
A text-based tool for the automatic backup of the main file on an android-based device with the help of the ADB through the network.


I had this idea when, once again, changing rom to my device, i had lost all data related to apps (like music and images). So I decided to use the adb through the network to automate the backup operation once a day and do not use the device, for example at night. the final idea would be to copy, every time the device connects to your wifi, only new files instead of copying even those backed up and replace them, also adding the new ones has already been made. I have prepared The basis of the program with the input for the ip to connect and manual backup of the main directory. Soon i'll upload the automated version of the program and then I hope to work together to get to the creation of the complete project that will be, of course, open source under all aspects.
