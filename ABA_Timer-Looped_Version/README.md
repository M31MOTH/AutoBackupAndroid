Thetimer looped version is now ready!
When you start it, after you've selected the folder that you want to backup, you'll be asked if you want to repeat the backup-op daily. With the version 1.0.0 the hour of the backup is the same of the hour you've started the backup-op. Next i'll add the feature for repeat at night and maybe not only daily but also weekly and much more.
